# Project 2

##Task 1: Return a Letter Grade from User Input

Write an Assembly program that will return a letter grade given a Decimal int from the user. Include the following:

a user menu
a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
a way for the user to continue getting letter grades or choose to exit
invalid input handling (do NOT just print an error message and exit the program; re-prompt the user until a correct input is entered)

##Task 2: Return a Letter Grade from Scores in Memory

Write an Assembly program that will return a letter grade for each element in an array (e.g. test scores in an array of scores). This task will have many similarities to Task 1. Use the following scores array data in your program:

int scores = [32, 56, 78, 66, 88, 90, 93, 100, 101, 82]

Include the following in your program:

a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
a loop counter
a separate case for grades above 100 (i.e. prints out "A with Extra Credit")

##Task 3: Advanced Math: x to the power of y

Write a program in Assembly that takes in two ints from a user. One int will be 'x' and the other will be 'y'. Make sure that user will know which value is 'x' and 'y'. Find the result of 'x' to the power of 'y'. Output the result to the user. Include the following in your program:

a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
a loop counter
